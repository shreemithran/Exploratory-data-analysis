# Exploratory-data-analysis
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on heart failure data, leveraging statistical and visualization techniques to gain insights and identify patterns in the data.

     Data Analytics has a key role in improving once business as it is used to gather hidden insights, generate reports, perform market analysis, and improve business requirements. Data is extracted from various sources and is cleaned and categorized to analyze various behavioral patterns. The techniques and the tools used vary according to the organization or individual. understand once field of Business Administration and have the capability to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, to gather the required information, results in a good outcome and strong standard of career in  Data Analytics.
Once we have identified the patterns and derived the necessary insights from the given data. A project of this scale can easily be done with Python, and for the packages, we can use pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and matplotlib.


WORKING PRINCIPLE
It is a associated to different fields of coding, creating and analysing .Thus taking a dataset that predicts the number of heart failure mortality .The main principle involved in this is Data cleaning by removing the duplicates and repetitions ,Data Analysis understanding the data by working on it to get different output , Data Interpretation  and Data visualization are finally used to get insights and good presentation views.Using python and its imported libraries in any open source available they are easily analyzsed    
Getting the dataset  
Removing the duplicates
Analysing getting hands on code
Output graphs are obtained 
A finial report or insights from those graphs are reported 
.  
COMPONENTS USED
 The main components of Data Science are given below:
1. Statistics: Statistics is a way to collect and analyze the numerical data in a large amount and finding meaningful insights from it.
2. Domain Expertise: Domain expertise means specialized knowledge or skills of a particular area. 
3. Data engineering: involves acquiring, storing, retrieving, and transforming the data. 
4. Visualization: Data visualization is meant by representing data in a visual context so that people can easily understand the significance of data. 
5. Advanced computing: Advanced computing involves designing, writing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs.
This project completely uses  only software components, the following are the software components used 
A programming language – python is used in this project for data analyzing.
A open source platform – working on the finest and fastest supportive open source for getting graphical outputs 
    Jupyter lab – An extensible environment for interactive and        reproducible computing.
A data set – to analysis and visualize data 
Python coding  
Finally a system to work on  the code and online open source
